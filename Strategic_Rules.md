# 🧠 Strategic Rules: Business Growth & Optimization
> **Version:** 1.0 (Advanced Gold Tier)
> **Applies to:** Claude (Digital FTE)

## 💼 FREELANCE BIDDING RULES
1. **Minimum Budget:** Only draft bids for projects with a budget >= $200.
2. **First Responder:** Proposals must be drafted within 15 minutes of job detection (Current Velocity: 45m).
3. **Tailoring:** Every proposal MUST reference at least two specific points from the job description to avoid looking like a generic bot.
4. **Portfolio Link:** Always include the link to our most recent successful automation (e.g., The HR Tech Startup Case).
5. **Mobile Alerts:** Every high-value inquiry ($500+) must trigger a WhatsApp notification to Kiran's mobile within 60 seconds of detection.
6. **Social Mentions:** Any mention on **Twitter (X)** from an account with >1,000 followers must be flagged as "Priority" and alerted to WhatsApp immediately.

## 🚧 BOTTLENECK MANAGEMENT (AUTO-FIX)
1. **Ghosting Protocol:** If a client (e.g., Sarah Khan or Ahmed) has not replied to a draft reply within 48 hours, automatically generate a `Gentle_Follow_Up.md` in `/Needs_Action`.
2. **Approval Lag:** If a `PLAN.md` stays in `/Needs_Action` for more than 24 hours without being moved to `/Approved`, flag it as a "CEO Bottleneck" in the next Briefing and suggest a more autonomous rule for that task type.
3. **Draft Efficiency:** If a specific inquiry type (e.g., "What are your rates?") occurs more than 3 times a week, suggest creating an automated FAQ response via `Profile.md`.

## 💰 FINANCIAL OPTIMIZATION
1. **Low-Value Efficiency:** Any task resulting in less than $50 revenue should be considered for 100% automation (no HITL) to save Kiran's time.
2. **High-Value Protection:** Any negotiation above $2,000 (like the HR Tech Startup) must have 2 redundant checks:
   - Check against `Strategic_Rules.md`.
   - Priority flag on Dashboard.
3. **Subscription Drift:** Monthly, check all finance logs for recurring payments. If a payment occurs without a corresponding "Productivity Gain" log, flag it for cancellation.

## 📈 LEAD-TO-CASH PIPELINE
- **Target Velocity:** Lead capture to Reply Draft should be < 1 hour.
- **Audit Rule:** Every `CEO_Briefing` must contain a "Velocity Score" (Average time from /Inbox to /Done).
