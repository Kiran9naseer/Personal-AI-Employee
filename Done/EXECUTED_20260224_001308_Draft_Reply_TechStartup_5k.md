Subject: Re: Digital FTE Implementation for our Team

Dear HR Team,

Thank you for reaching out! I am thrilled to see your interest in our **Digital FTE** systems for your HR onboarding automation.

Automating onboarding is one of the highest-impact areas for tech startups. Our systems can handle documentation, access provisioning, and orientation schedules autonomously, reducing human effort by over 80%.

Regarding the **$5,000 package**, I would love to jump on a strategy call to understand your specific workflow requirements and ensure we build a solution that scales with your team.

Are you available for a Zoom meeting on Thursday afternoon?

Best regards,
**Kiran Naseer**
