Dear Investors,

Thank you for reaching out! It's exciting to see interest in the **Digital FTE** scaling model. 

The architecture we've built using **Claude Code** and **Obsidian** is designed specifically for high-growth scalability and local-first security. I have attached the initial roadmap and pitch deck outline for your review.

I am currently available for a discovery call this Friday at 4:00 PM.
